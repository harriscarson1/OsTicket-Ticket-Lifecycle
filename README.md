</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
After clicking open a new ticket I will make a ticket as Karen G 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<br />
<p>
Now we will login as an agent and observe
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
In the agent panel we can see we got the ticket
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37a3b33d-5cab-4f62-b92f-8b2cfd5ffa60" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
In the ticket we can see and set the priority, the department, the SLA, and who it might be specifically assigned to
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83d28e3-1bb0-49aa-a2c3-470caf8e7428" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
We can change each of these to what they need to be changed too, Sev-A, Emergency priority, and assigned to the mobile banking department. As soon as we do this we will no longer have access to the ticket

</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ddcc98-66e8-4adb-bfad-ea1d80b2cc06" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
Now I will have to login to john doe who is in the mobile banking department and will have access to the ticket. But you can see that he does not have access to change SLA Priority ect., because he is set to read only

</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785457ec-1ea2-4282-9ab2-35cc7bd2a4e4" height="80%" width="80%"/>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b5e0862-a019-4fc2-a299-f1d400c8b738" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you scroll down you can respond to the ticket in the internal notes.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c19a58-e613-443a-9779-7ff71a1bc90f" height="80%" width="80%"/>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06253562-d52e-412c-ab8a-d193c7d768f9" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
Now we can log in as jane doe who is a SysAdmin
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c42f84f8-1e2c-4d7c-98e3-0bc7e0f27335" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
From Jane's perspective she is able to edit the status priority because she has admin level access to the online banking group.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<p>
Now after the issue has be resolved we can set the ticket status from open to closed to complete the ticket
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6dc368-a74d-4da5-9d2d-5c0da1966d81" height="80%" width="80%"/>
</p>
<br />
<p>
The ticket was now completed.
</p>
